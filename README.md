# Colonial
## Introduction
Colonial is a turn-based multiplayer strategy game. Players must create and move pieces around a board of randomly generated terrain, settling and conquering territory until they are the only faction remaining. The game is online-multiplayer, made in Unity in C#, with the networking done in Photon Fusion 2.
## About the Project
## Personal Comment
I wanted to develop something akin to 'The Battle of Polytopia' in my free time, I'm a huge fan of the game and this project was less about making an open-source competitor but rather just trying to learn more about networking in Unity. I've made multiplayer games before, but haven't worked on any since 2021 and I was well aware starting this project that my toolset was out-of-date at best. My previous projects have all been chat-room styled games where players connect to a session and role-play as various characters, so I viewed a multiplayer strategy game as something complex enough to be a real challenge to develop.

I've learned alot about networking, I'm very proud of this project and had alot of fun working on it. I do feel I made a few mistakes early-on that limited development however. Primarily the game uses the client-host p2p model. This creates issues communicating information and the game struggles to run on browser to the degree that I have avoided uploading a WebGL version. This is a particular shame as this was a real hope I had for the project that was lost due to poor research and planning. I've traditionally used photon and I have found them to be a reliable service, however the poor documentation for Photon Fusion 2, the clashing hosting styles and the empty forums made it very frustrating to work with compared to legacy versions. I want to continue making multiplayer games so these were valuable lessons to learn that I will be taking forward.

One huge takeaway for me though was how fun creating a procedural game was. I'm a programmer at heart and when developing video games I often find myself becoming burnt out at the level design and art stages of development. Having a project where I can quickly create a feature and see it's immediate effect on the game world was so much fun and is something I will 100% be taking further on future projects.

Overall, I had a lot of fun with this, I hope you find some enjoyment playing it. Thank you!
