# Colonial
## Introduction
Colonial is a turn-based multiplayer strategy game. Players must create and move pieces around a board of randomly generated terrain, settling and conquering territory until they are the only faction remaining.
The game is online-multiplayer, made in Unity in C#, with the networking done in Photon Fusion 2.

## Comparative to _The Battle of Polytopia_
This game is heavily inspired by _The Battle of Polytopia_. I love _The Battle of Polytopia_, my favourite aspect of the gameplay loop has always been the nation building, which sadly isn't the main focus. This is my attempt to capture what Polytopia has, whilst building upon the nation building mechanics. I've designed some key changes.
 - The map takes place on a hexagonal grid.
 - The map is Minecraft-styled randomly generated terrain.
 - Players can be within the same faction and work together.
 - Each faction has a flag and identity for roleplay.
 - Resources are now split into four categories: currency, population, produce and materials.
 - Troops require different variable amounts of resources to be spawned and used.
 - Tech tree progression is dependant on resource availablity.
 - A more expansive peace treaty system, where players can set a turn limit for the treaty as well as demand successions from other players.
 - Gift/trade system, where players can gift or trade resources.
 - Coalition system where players can agree to attack a specific faction without defining final peace between them.
 - Roads are much more valuable as connected cities now share resources.
 - Roads and builings can be pillaged and/or destroyed.
 - Engineer class can place certain buildings on unmarked territory.
 - Random world events such as storms.
 - Buffs and Debuffs to resource management via political decisions and random luck-based events.

Not all of these changes will make it into the final product, they are all dependant on how good they feel to play.
This project is not finished, but will be updated regularily as I continue to progress on it.

## Closing Thoughts
This is easily the most fun I've ever had on a project. This is the second strategy game I've made and practicing my netcode and other good programming practices has been a great excercise.
There is currently no license on the project, as I haven't decided which to use. Not that this project gets much attention anyway. I expect I'll add a license when I'm done with the project.
