Make troops say RAMMMPAAGE when killing multiple in a row. Satisfying chains? Troop killed means they get to fire again? (for certain troops?) (TRUE PATRIOT maybe)

Forts do not upgrade themselves, stars are produced directly by buildings. Buildings can also increase the cap of a town on different resources;

- Population, capped score resource made by houses and social buildings like ports and churches. Defines the amount of spawnable troops.

- Materials, capped resource produced by trees, mines. Each troop type costs an amount of material (eg villagers cost none, infantry costs 1 for the rifle and cannons cost a large amount). Connected towns share their combined materials.

- Produce, capped resource produced by farms and livestock. Troops also cost produce depending on the type. Also shared via supply lines.

Buildings also produce a currency value for the player to spend each turn. This can be on new buildings or troops.

The fort building can be upgraded with stars to increase a bases influence for a large cost. 

Buildings can be raided by opponent troops. Raiding a building will give the attacking player a currency bonus and leave the building looking dilapidated and destroyed. The owning player must then either destroy the building for free or restore it for a charge. The building doesn't produce anything while it is destroyed. If the player has fort that can't sustain it's troops, any troops from that fort have a debuff status applied.

Players also have an executive orders panel that can be used for things such as sending peace treatys, messages or currency to other players.
